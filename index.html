    <h2>Achievments</h2>
    <h3>Master's Electrical Engineering Project</h3>
    <p>
        Develop new Hardware and software for the design and implementation of several control algorithms for 
        a three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. The main problem of the project was to develop a Real-Time 
        Application where the controller parameters can be changed to get the fastest tunning. The controller is 
        located on the robot, and the parameters are received via WiFi from an external Laptop. Despite the 
        parameters, the software can obtain real-time plots and data to verify the signals calculated on the Robot. 
        The hardware was based on a Raspberry Pi 4 running on Linux(Ubuntu), using ROS. The robot code was developed 
        in both, C and Python.

    <h3>"Ignacio Aguilera" Youtube Channel</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my hobbies I always have created standalone projects and one way to share people what I do
        was to create a youtube channel to share the new thing I learned o a new gadget I purchased or professional 
        experiences
